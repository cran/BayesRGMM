Description: To perform model estimation using MCMC algorithms with Bayesian methods for incomplete longitudinal studies on binary and ordinal outcomes that are measured repeatedly on subjects over time with drop-outs. Details about the method can be found in the vignette or <https://sites.google.com/view/kuojunglee/r-packages/bayesrgmm>.
